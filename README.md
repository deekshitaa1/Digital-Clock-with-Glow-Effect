# Digital-Clock-with-Glow-Effect
Today I built a Digital Clock with Neon Glow Effect using HTML + CSS + JavaScript.

This project helped me learn:

🔹 How to update UI every second using setInterval()
🔹 How to style glowing digital text using text-shadow
🔹 How to create a clean, minimal UI with a dark + neon theme
🔹 How to center content perfectly using Flexbox
🔹 How to format real-time time display in JavaScript
